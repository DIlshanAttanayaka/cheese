please fix me before 3.0

8 show a throbber when doing something which could take some time, e.g.
  changing effects, loading webcam, starting recording video
7 while the webcam is loading, do not allow to take a picture, access
  preferences etc.
7 improve video recording (doesnt work here atm)
6 move to gsettings
? move to gapplication
? move to gtk3
5 fix effects preview layout in fullscreen
5 remove all warnings when compiling
4 when maximizing the window, the webcam video still stays the same size
3 streamline menu items
3 beautify effects preview, e.g. only a thin white border
2 startup time is till quite long
2 overlay effect previews with their names

NOTES, particularly about "show a throbber" and startup time

Who's taking so much time at cheese startup?
- cheese_camera_connect_effect_texture

That's the most expensive thing we do, it takes a rough 50% (maybe more)
of startup time, particularly link_many for each effect is quite
expensive because it has to match colorspace caps (but in general, gst
linking is slow).

Can it be avoided? I doubt so. Can it be postponed? definitely.

There's no reason to link all the effects at startup, the
highest priority thing at startup is show the window and put an image
into it (or if the camera preview takes some time to show up at least
show something moving like a throbber as we always did).  The effects
section of the pipeline can be isolated with a valve,
meanwhile the main pipeline can be started, when the effects are ready
we can connect them. Ideally given they all have a valve we could
connect them one at the time and show a throbber for each one. So when
the user clicks on effect he can see that they are progressively
loading (or if it clicks on effects when they are ready he won't notice
the loading thing at all).

Obviously all this stuff has to be done async so that the UI doesn't
ever block waiting for each task to complete. This could be done with a
separate thread like we did or taking advantage of gstreamer async
facilities (GstBus, GstMessages) or, probably, with a mix of the two.
