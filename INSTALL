This is the INSTALL file for cheese
http://live.gnome.org/Cheese
========================================================================

While the core code is not platorm specific, the build tree and
configure script are *quite* GNU-specific, and REQUIRE "recent"
versions of the most common GNU tools, like sed, GNU make, GNU tar,
gzip, etc. Complete docs for the build tree can be found on the build
tool's home page:

        http://toc.sourceforge.net

cheese uses a conventional 'configure' script, which is run like so:

        ./configure [--options]

Run it with --help to see the complete list of options. None are
normally necessary, but setting a prefix is required if you want
to install cheese as a non-root user:

        ./configure --prefix=$HOME
(i.e., somewhere to which you have write access)

If configure finds problems then you won't be able to build s11n
without manual intervention - feel free to contact us if you
have build problems.

After configuring, simply:

        make
        make install

Of course the Makefile provides also the DESTDIR option, which
allows you to put the package content somewhere else:

        make DESTDIR=$HOME install

If you want to uninstall the package, run:

        make uninstall
        make DESTDIR=$HOME uninstall (if you used the DESTDIR-variable above)
