  <title>Delete a photo or video</title>

  <p>If you don't want a photo or video anymore, you can permanently delete it:</p>

  <steps>
    <item>
     <p>Find the photo or video that you want to delete in the photo stream at the bottom of the Cheese window.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
     <p>Right-click it and select <gui>Delete</gui>. Alternatively,
    click it once to select it and press <key>Delete</key>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
     <p>You will be asked if you want to permanently delete it. Click <gui>Delete</gui> if you do; you will not be able to recover the photo.</p>
    </item>
  </steps>

<p>If you're not sure if you want to permanently delete the photo or video, you can right click it and select <gui>Move to Trash</gui> instead. This will put it in your computer's main <file>Trash</file> folder. (Cheese doesn't have its own Trash folder, and you can't access the computer's main Trash from within Cheese.)</p>
