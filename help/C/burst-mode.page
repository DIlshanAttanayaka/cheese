  <title>Take multiple photos in rapid succession</title>

  <p>You can use Burst Mode to automatically take several photos in one go, with a short pause between each shot. It's particularly fun if you change your pose in between pictures! To use Burst Mode:</p>

  <steps>
    <item>
     <p>Click the small button that looks like a stack of photos in the lower left of the Cheese window. If you clicked the right one, the button in the center of the window should now say <gui>Take Multiple Photos</gui>.</p>
     <p>Alternatively, click <guiseq><gui>Cheese</gui><gui>Burst</gui></guiseq>.</p>
    </item>
    <item>
     <p>Click <gui>Take Multiple Photos</gui> or press the <key>spacebar</key>.</p>
     <p>By default, four photos will be taken, with a three second delay between each photo. You'll see a countdown before each photo is taken.</p>
    </item>
  </steps>

<p>Press <key>Esc</key> if you want to stop Cheese from taking photos at any point.</p>
